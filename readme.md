A modern Prolog implementation in Rust with enhanced error handling, comprehensive built-ins, and developer-friendly features.

## 🏛️ Why "Neorusticus"?

The name **Neorusticus** carries deep meaning that reflects the project's philosophy and aspirations:

### **Neo** - Modern Innovation

The "Neo" prefix represents the modern, experimental approach to logic programming. It suggests evolution beyond traditional Prolog into areas like:

- Probabilistic reasoning
- Constraint logic programming
- AI-assisted development methodologies
- Integration with modern computational paradigms

### **Rusticus** - Classical Foundations

"Rusticus" has multiple layers of meaning:

**🏛️ Historical Depth**: References **Junius Rusticus**, the Stoic philosopher and teacher of Marcus Aurelius. This connection is perfect for logic programming, which has deep philosophical roots in formal reasoning and logical inference—core concepts in Stoic philosophy.

**🌾 Earthy Practicality**: In Latin, "rusticus" means "of the countryside"—practical, grounded, and unpretentious. This fits both Rust's earthy, no-nonsense approach to systems programming and the project's focus on building something genuinely useful rather than merely academic.

**🔬 Academic Gravitas**: The name sounds scholarly and distinctive, appropriate for a serious exploration of language implementation and logic programming concepts.

**🛠️ Experimental Spirit**: The "rough around the edges" connotation captures the experimental nature of this AI-assisted development project—it's a work in progress, a learning journey, not a polished commercial product.

Together, **Neorusticus** embodies the vision of bringing classical logic programming wisdom into the modern era through Rust's safety and performance, while remaining open to experimental evolution.

## Ψ The Logo

The **Psi (Ψ)** symbol serves as Neorusticus's logo, chosen for its rich symbolic meaning:

### **🧠 Mind & Consciousness**

Psi represents the mind, consciousness, and mental processes—perfect for a system that performs logical reasoning and artificial intelligence.

### **⚡ Computational Logic**

In computer science and AI, Psi often symbolizes intelligent systems, logical inference, and computational thinking.

### **🏛️ Classical Foundation**

The symbol's Greek origins echo the classical foundations of logic (Aristotle, Stoics) while the clean, geometric form represents modern computational precision.

### **🚀 Transcendent Potential**

The elevated, distinctive shape suggests rising above traditional limitations—fitting for a project that might evolve beyond conventional Prolog into experimental territories.

The Psi symbol perfectly captures Neorusticus's essence: a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern innovation, between human reasoning and artificial intelligence, between classical logic and experimental possibilities.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Neorusticus serves multiple ambitious goals that go beyond just building another Prolog implementation:

### 🦀 **Learn Rust Through Real-World Application**

Rather than learning Rust through tutorials and toy examples, this project explores advanced Rust concepts—pattern matching, error handling, lifetimes, zero-cost abstractions, and memory safety—through a substantial, practical implementation. Every design decision provides deep insights into what makes Rust unique for systems programming.

### 🧠 **Deep Understanding of Prolog Implementation**

Building a complete Prolog interpreter from scratch—lexer, parser, unification algorithm, and execution engine—provides intimate knowledge of how logic programming languages work. This includes understanding SLD resolution, backtracking, cut operations, and the subtleties of variable scoping and renaming.

### 🔬 **Flexible Framework for Future Exploration**

Neorusticus is designed as a foundation for exploring advanced logic programming concepts and experimental features. The modular architecture allows for future expansion into areas like:

- Constraint Logic Programming (CLP)
- Tabled resolution and memoization
- Probabilistic logic programming
- Integration with machine learning systems
- Novel optimization techniques
- Educational tools and visualizations

### 🤖 **AI-Assisted Development Experiment**

This project serves as a comprehensive case study in AI-assisted software development, with AI tools playing dual roles:

- **🎓 Expert Advisor**: Providing architectural guidance, best practices, algorithm explanations, and design recommendations
- **💻 Code Developer**: Generating implementations, writing tests, debugging issues, and refactoring code

The goal is to evaluate how effectively AI can contribute to complex software projects when working with a technical leader who provides direction, requirements, and quality oversight. This collaboration model represents a new paradigm in software development that's worth studying and documenting.

This multi-faceted approach makes Neorusticus both a learning vehicle and a research platform, demonstrating the potential of combining human expertise with AI capabilities to tackle ambitious technical projects.

## 📚 Documentation

### Built-in Predicates

#### Arithmetic Operations

```prolog
?- X is 2 + 3 * 4.     % X = 14 (respects precedence)
?- 5 > 3.              % true
?- 10 =:= 5 + 5.       % true (arithmetic equality)
?- 7 =\= 3.            % true (arithmetic inequality)
```

#### List Operations

```prolog
?- append([1, 2], [3, 4], X).    % X = [1, 2, 3, 4]
?- member(2, [1, 2, 3]).         % true
?- length([a, b, c], X).         % X = 3
```

#### Type Checking

```prolog
?- var(X).             % true (X is uninstantiated)
?- atom(hello).        % true
?- number(42).         % true
?- compound(f(x)).     % true
```

#### Control Flow

```prolog
% Cut operation prevents backtracking
max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y, !.
max(X, Y, Y).

?- max(5, 3, Z).       % Z = 5 (doesn't try second clause)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Error Handling with Suggestions

```prolog
?- lentgh([1, 2, 3], X).
Error: Undefined predicate: lentgh/2. Did you mean: length/2

?- appendd([1], [2], X).
Error: Undefined predicate: appendd/3. Did you mean: append/3
```

#### Stack Overflow Protection

```rust
let mut engine = PrologEngine::with_config(100, 50); // max solutions, max stack depth
engine.parse_and_add("infinite(X) :- infinite(X).").unwrap();

// This will error instead of hanging:
let result = engine.parse_query("infinite(test).");
// Error: Stack overflow (depth 50) in predicate: infinite/1
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Engine Limits

```rust
use neorusticus::PrologEngine;

// Create engine with custom limits
let mut engine = PrologEngine::with_config(
    1000,  // Maximum solutions
    200,   // Maximum stack depth
);

// Or adjust limits later
engine.set_max_solutions(500);
engine.set_max_stack_depth(100);
```

### Error Handling

```rust
use neorusticus::PrologEngine;

let mut engine = PrologEngine::new();

match engine.parse_and_add("invalid syntax here") {
    Ok(()) => println!("Added successfully"),
    Err(e) => {
        engine.print_error(&e);  // Pretty-printed error with context
    }
}
```
